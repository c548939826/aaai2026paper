This repository contains the code and data for our AAAI 2026 submission **FairTune: A Self-Guided Fairness Testing and Repair Approach for Machine Translation**
## Overview
FairTune is a framework for testing and repairing fairness issues in machine translation systems. It identifies unfair translations related to gender, race, and other protected attributes, and uses LLM-based regeneration to mitigate bias.
## Getting Started
**python main.py**
## Dependenices
NLTK 3.2.1
Pytorch 1.6.1
Python 3.7
Ubuntu 16.04
Transformers 3.3.0
openai 1.72.0

## Fairness Evaluation Standard
For all fairness-related evaluations, we adhere to the criteria outlined in our official evaluation standard.
